# AWS SigV4 Proxy backend plugin

Backend plugin that enables proxy definitions to be declared in, and read from, `app-config.yaml` (just like the
built-in [`proxy-backend` plugin][1]) that will be signed using the [AWS Signature Version 4 (SigV4) request-signing
algorithm][2].

Loosely modeled after the official [AWS SigV4 Proxy project (awslabs/aws-sigv4-proxy)][3].

## Getting started

This plugin has already been added to the Backstage app in this repository, meaning you'll be able to try out
the plugin by firstly adding your [Proxy Sigv4 Configuration](#configuration) to the `app-config.yaml` located in
the root folder of this repository. After that, you should be able to access it by starting the app, and then navigating
to [/api/proxy-sigv4/\*](http://localhost:7007/api/proxy-sigv4/*).

This backend plugin can also be started in a standalone mode via `yarn start` from within this package; however, it will
have limited functionality and this process is most convenient when developing the plugin itself. If you develop using
the standalone server, note that the plugin is mounted at the backend root and _not_ under `/api/`:
[/proxy-sigv4/\*](http://localhost:7007/proxy-sigv4/*).

## Installation

### Add the backend plugin as a dependency to `packages/backend`

```sh
yarn add --cwd packages/backend '@segment/backstage-plugin-proxy-sigv4-backend'
```

### New Backend System

The AWS SigV4 Proxy backend plugin has support for the [new backend system](https://backstage.io/docs/backend-system/). In your `packages/backend/src/index.ts` file, make the following changes:

```diff
  import { createBackend } from '@backstage/backend-defaults';
  const backend = createBackend();
  // ... other feature additions

+ // proxy-sigv4 plugin installation
+ backend.add(import('@segment/backstage-plugin-proxy-sigv4-backend'));

  backend.start();
```

### Legacy Backend System

#### Create a new backend plugin wrapper module

If you are still using the legacy backend system, you'll need to add the plugin to the router in your `backend` package.

You can do this by creating a file called `packages/backend/src/plugins/proxy-sigv4.ts`. Example content for
`proxy-sigv4.ts` could be something like this.

```ts
// packages/backend/src/plugins/proxy-sigv4.ts

import { createRouter } from '@segment/backstage-plugin-proxy-sigv4-backend';
import { Router } from 'express';
import { PluginEnvironment } from '../types';

export default async function createPlugin({
  logger,
  config,
}: PluginEnvironment): Promise<Router> {
  return await createRouter({ logger, config });
}
```

#### Initialize the wrapper module and mount the router in `packages/backend`

With the `proxy-sigv4.ts` router setup in place, add the router to `packages/backend/src/index.ts`:

```diff
 // packages/backend/src/index.ts

+import proxySigV4 from './plugins/proxy-sigv4';

 async function main() {
   ...
   const createEnv = makeCreateEnv(config);
   ...

   const proxyEnv = useHotMemoize(module, () => createEnv('proxy'));
+  const proxySigV4Env = useHotMemoize(module, () => createEnv('proxy-sigv4'));

   const apiRouter = Router();

   apiRouter.use('/proxy', await proxy(proxyEnv));
+  apiRouter.use('/proxy-sigv4', await proxySigV4(proxySignV4Env));
   ...
 }
```

## Configuration

Proxy routes can be configured using either a short or expanded form.

### Short form

The short form is useful when the default [`AWS.CredentialProviderChain`][4] resolves to a set of AWS credentials that
have the permissions necessary to invoke the target API directly.

This is commonplace when the [IAM instance profile][5] has been configured with a role that has been granted access on
the target API and no additional [`AssumeRole` call][6] is required.

This is also useful during local development when the shell environment used to start the application already has AWS
credentials exported into the shell's environment variables.

```yaml
proxysigv4:
  '/some-local-path': https://<API ID>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com
```

### Expanded form

The expanded form is necessary when:

- `AssumeRole` call _is_ required, _or_ if the target API service and region cannot
  be automatically derived from the URL (commonplace when a custom domain name has been configured for an API Gateway
  endpoint).
- The service if not possible to determine it automatically.
- The region if not possible to determine it automatically.

```yaml
proxysigv4:
  '/some-local-path':
    target: 'https://<API ID>.execute-api.<region>.amazonaws.com'
    roleArn: 'arn:aws:iam::<account>:role/<name>'
    roleSessionName: tempAssumeRoleSession ## optional
    service: '<service>' ## optional
    region: '<region>' ## optional
```

### New Auth Services - Unauthorized Requests

When using the new backend system with the [new auth services](https://backstage.io/docs/tutorials/auth-service-migration/), the `proxy-sigv4` backend plugin will by default allow unauthenticated requests.

To prevent this behavior, provide the following configuration:

```yaml
proxysigv4:
  allowUnauthenticatedRequests: false
```

Doing so will not add the auth policty that allows unauthenticated requests.

### Schema

Refer to [`config.d.ts`][7] for the full plugin type definition.

## Limitations

1. No response streaming.
1. No configuration of the forwarded or received headers allowlist.
1. No ability to override or manually configure target URL `service` and `region` properties
   - CNAME'd endpoints are therefore not currently supported
1. Target URLs that lack a trailing slash (`/`) will always have one implicitly applied.
   - e.g.: `https://example.com/foo` will be treated as `https://example.com/foo/`
1. Target URLs with a path prefix _may_ be susceptible to path traversal attacks; test coverage for this is poor.
